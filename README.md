This gamemode was originally used for an All vs. All Tournament in 2020, organized by my own clan [USL] and our friends of the [AMB] clan.

Hello everyone,

we would like to invite you all to our All vs. All Tournament. The event will take place at Las Venturas Strip and will be organized by us together with the AMB-Clan.

The winner of the event will receive a prize of 50â‚¬ which will be transferred via PayPal. We reserve the right to decide if place 2-3 will be rewarded as well. This will be determined at a later date based on the number of participants.
